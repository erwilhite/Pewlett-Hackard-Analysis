# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
This analysis was performed to assist Pewlett Hackard in determining the number of current employees that will be retiring soon based on birth dates between 1952 and 1955 (between 67 and 70 years old) and hire date between 1985 and 1988. Additionally, an analysis was completed to see employees that could benefit for a mentorship program based on birth dates from the year 1965

## Results
-	There are 72,458 employees qualified for retirement within the company
    - 25,916 are senior engineers 
    -	24,926 are senior staff
    -	The remaining are engineers, staff, technique leaders, assistant engineers, and managers
-	This comprises 24% of the total 300,024 strong workforce
-	1,499 employees are qualified for the company mentorship program

## Summary
In conclusion, almost 73,000 roles will need to be filled because of this retirement group, the majority of which are senior positions. With this being almost a quarter of the workforce, and only 1% of employees are eligible for the mentorship program, it would not seem there would be an issue with the ability for the retiring employees to train their mentees. However, with this disparity in groups, it would be advised to seek more qualified talent to fill the roles. Additional queries that would be beneficial to strengthen this analysis would be to determine the percentage of titles retiring from each title as well as the amount qualified for mentorship per title group.
